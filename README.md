# ðŸš— Vehicle Detection, Tracking, and Counting System

This project implements a complete pipeline for real-time vehicle detection, tracking, and counting from traffic footage using deep learning and object tracking algorithms. Two object detectors â€” **Faster R-CNN** and **YOLOv8** â€” are trained and evaluated, with tracking handled by **ByteTrack**. The final system supports both **video file** and **webcam input** and provides optional **traffic density estimation**.

## Project Tasks & Pipeline

### Dataset Exploration and Image Preprocessing
- Inspected dataset folder structure, annotation format, and class definitions.
- Applied resizing and normalization to prepare images for training.

### Object Detection Models
- **Faster R-CNN**: Trained using pretrained ResNet-50 backbone on custom traffic dataset.
- **YOLOv8**: Trained using Ultralytics' latest YOLO release with fine-tuning on vehicle classes.

### Multi-Object Tracking
- Integrated **ByteTrack** to maintain unique identities across frames.
- Enabled object-level tracking and ID persistence for accurate counting.

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Detection**:
  - `Precision`, `Recall`, `IoU`, `mAP@0.5`, `mAP@0.5:0.95`

### Training & Optimization
- Models trained for **at least 50 epochs**.
- Early stopping and validation loss monitoring used.
- Regularization strategies and augmentations applied to mitigate overfitting.

### Traffic Density Estimation
- Simple rule-based classification (based on object count threshold) used to label density as `Low`, `Medium`, or `High`.
